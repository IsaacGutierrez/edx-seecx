# EDX - TUMx: SEECx Software Engineering Essentials


Slide to MD files transcription to anyone o need it.

If you wanna help, just clone this repo and start working on the Week video.

### Rules

* Try to mimic the titles and text format (if need help, check the markdown link on the bottom)
* When images are required, in every week folder exists an _"assets"_ folder, just create a numeric folder for the number of the class.
    * Dont forget the traling zero (eg: 01,02...)
* Images should be named image00.png (can be jpg), and 00 changed by a sequencial number by the appearence order
