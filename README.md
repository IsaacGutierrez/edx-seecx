# EDX - TUMx: SEECx Software Engineering Essentials

## Disclaimer

This is a student project to provide supplementary material and that these are _**not**_ official course artifacts.

### Intro

If you wanna help, just clone this repo and start working on the Week video.

### Rules

* Try to mimic the titles and text format (if need help, check the markdown link on the bottom)
* When images are required, in every week folder exists an _"assets"_ folder, just create a numeric folder for the number of the class.
    * Dont forget the traling zero (eg: 01,02...)
* Images should be named imageXX.png (can be jpg), and XX changed for a sequencial number by it appearence order
